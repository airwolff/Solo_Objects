# Solo-Object
Reason why I am doing this:
- to learn
- to better use what we've learned?
- using objects

Reason why I chose to model this team as an object:
- It asked for a team, I don't follow sports. So...
- just making stuff up.
- uhm, 

Output:
In console log, you would get a read able paragraph with object properties inside the string.
For Example: "string" object property "string"...so on
